# Training and Optimizing ONNX Models with DSPy: A Step-by-Step Pipeline

## 1. Model Training with DSPy 
Start by developing and training your model using DSPy (Declarative Self-improving Python). DSPy allows you to **program your model’s behavior as modular Python code** and provides optimizers to tune model parameters or prompts using training data ([GitHub - stanfordnlp/dspy: DSPy: The framework for programming—not prompting—language models](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/dspy#:~:text=DSPy%20is%20the%20framework%20for,RAG%20pipelines%2C%20or%20Agent%20loops)). For example, you can define a DSPy module for your task (like a classifier or QA system) and compile it with a training dataset to improve its performance:

- **Define the Model Module**: Use DSPy’s primitives (e.g. `dspy.Signature`, `dspy.ChainOfThought`, etc.) to describe your model’s input-output signature and logic. DSPy supports building classifiers or even complex pipelines (RAG, agents) as compositional modules rather than static prompts ([GitHub - stanfordnlp/dspy: DSPy: The framework for programming—not prompting—language models](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/dspy#:~:text=DSPy%20is%20the%20framework%20for,RAG%20pipelines%2C%20or%20Agent%20loops)).  
- **Provide Training Data**: Prepare a `trainset` of DSPy `Example` objects containing inputs and expected outputs (labels). DSPy can utilize this data to optimize the model. For instance: 

  ```python
  import dspy
  from my_dataset import train_data  # your dataset of (input, label)
  
  # Define a simple classification module (e.g., text -> label)
  signature = dspy.Signature("text -> label")
  classifier = dspy.ChainOfThought(signature)
  
  # Wrap training data into DSPy Examples
  trainset = [dspy.Example(text, label=lbl).with_inputs("text") for text, lbl in train_data]
  ```
- **Optimize/Train the Model**: Invoke DSPy’s optimizer to **train** the module on the dataset. DSPy’s `compile` function will adjust the module (e.g., tune prompt parameters or even model weights if integrated with an LM) to improve performance ([DSPy](https://dspy.ai/#:~:text=optimized_react%20%3D%20tp)). For example, using a built-in optimizer:
  ```python
  optimizer = dspy.Optimizer(metric="accuracy")  # choose appropriate optimizer/metric
  optimized_model = optimizer.compile(classifier, trainset=trainset)
  ```
  This process will iteratively improve the model’s outputs on the training set (DSPy reports improved scores, e.g. raising accuracy from 24% to 51% after optimization in one case ([DSPy](https://dspy.ai/#:~:text=optimized_react%20%3D%20tp))). Under the hood, if your model involves a neural network, you can integrate PyTorch or TensorFlow training inside the DSPy module. Ensure the model is trained to a satisfactory accuracy before export.

- **Finalize Trained Weights**: Once optimized, extract the underlying trained model. For example, if your DSPy module uses a PyTorch model internally, you’d retrieve that PyTorch model with its trained weights. This model will be converted to ONNX in the next step.

**Citation (DSPy Training)**: DSPy offers algorithms to optimize prompts and weights of AI modules using training data ([GitHub - stanfordnlp/dspy: DSPy: The framework for programming—not prompting—language models](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/dspy#:~:text=DSPy%20is%20the%20framework%20for,RAG%20pipelines%2C%20or%20Agent%20loops)). For instance, compiling a DSPy module with a training set can significantly boost its performance ([DSPy](https://dspy.ai/#:~:text=optimized_react%20%3D%20tp)).

## 2. ONNX Conversion (Exporting the Model to ONNX)
With a trained model in hand (e.g., a PyTorch model from the DSPy pipeline), export it to ONNX format. **Best practices** for ONNX export ensure the model is compatible with ONNX Runtime:

- **Use Framework Export Tools**: If using PyTorch, call `torch.onnx.export()` on your model. Ensure the model is in evaluation mode (`model.eval()`) and provide a dummy input of the correct shape and type. PyTorch’s exporter will run the model once to trace operations and produce an ONNX graph ([(optional) Exporting a Model from PyTorch to ONNX and Running it using ONNX Runtime — PyTorch Tutorials 2.6.0+cu124 documentation](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/advanced/super_resolution_with_onnxruntime.html#:~:text=Exporting%20a%20model%20in%20PyTorch,model%20will%20thus%20accept%20inputs)). For example: 

  ```python
  import torch
  dummy_input = torch.randn(1, 3, 224, 224)  # example input shape
  torch.onnx.export(model, dummy_input, "model.onnx", 
                    opset_version=13,  # choose a suitable opset
                    do_constant_folding=True,  # fold constants for optimization
                    input_names=['input'], output_names=['output'])
  ```
  This executes the model with `dummy_input` and records the operators to an ONNX graph ([(optional) Exporting a Model from PyTorch to ONNX and Running it using ONNX Runtime — PyTorch Tutorials 2.6.0+cu124 documentation](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/advanced/super_resolution_with_onnxruntime.html#:~:text=Exporting%20a%20model%20in%20PyTorch,dynamic_axes)). Set `opset_version` to a value supported by your ONNX Runtime (ORT) version (ORT 1.15+ supports opset 18+; opset 13 is a safe choice for broad compatibility). The `do_constant_folding=True` flag pre-computes constant expressions for a smaller graph.

- **Enable Dynamic Axes**: By default, ONNX export will fix all input and output dimensions. To allow variable batch sizes or sequence lengths, specify `dynamic_axes`. For example, to make the batch dimension flexible: 
  ```python
  torch.onnx.export(model, dummy_input, "model.onnx", opset_version=13, 
                    input_names=['input'], output_names=['output'],
                    dynamic_axes={'input': {0: 'batch_size'}, 'output': {0: 'batch_size'}})
  ``` 
  This marks axis 0 of input/output as dynamic so the exported model accepts different batch sizes ([Help needen to convert torch models to onnx  : r/pytorch](https://www.reddit.com/r/pytorch/comments/1cxk54z/help_needen_to_convert_torch_models_to_onnx/#:~:text=,onnx%27%2C%20opset_version%3D11%2C%20dynamic_axes%3Ddynamic_axes)) ([(optional) Exporting a Model from PyTorch to ONNX and Running it using ONNX Runtime — PyTorch Tutorials 2.6.0+cu124 documentation](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/advanced/super_resolution_with_onnxruntime.html#:~:text=,where%20batch_size%20can%20be%20variable)). It’s crucial for inference efficiency if you plan to vary input sizes or do single-image inference.

- **Check for Unsupported Ops**: Ensure your model uses operations supported by ONNX. Avoid custom layers or PyTorch functions that don’t have ONNX equivalents. If unavoidable, you may need to provide custom operator implementations or simplify the model. Use `onnx.checker.check_model()` to verify the exported model’s integrity ([Help needen to convert torch models to onnx  : r/pytorch](https://www.reddit.com/r/pytorch/comments/1cxk54z/help_needen_to_convert_torch_models_to_onnx/#:~:text=%2A%20Data%20Types%3A%20Double,range%20expected%20by%20your%20model)) ([(optional) Exporting a Model from PyTorch to ONNX and Running it using ONNX Runtime — PyTorch Tutorials 2.6.0+cu124 documentation](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/advanced/super_resolution_with_onnxruntime.html#:~:text=But%20before%20verifying%20the%20model%E2%80%99s,and%20their%20inputs%20and%20outputs)):
  ```python
  import onnx
  onnx_model = onnx.load("model.onnx")
  onnx.checker.check_model(onnx_model)  # validates the model graph
  ```
  Address any errors (for example, shape mismatches or unsupported ops).

- **Optimize the ONNX Model** (optional): You can apply graph optimizations offline using tools like ONNX simplifier or Polygraphy. This can fold redundant nodes and improve runtime compatibility. For example:
  ```bash
  python -m onnxsim model.onnx model_simplified.onnx
  ```
  (Make sure the simplifier doesn’t alter the model’s accuracy.)

- **Test the ONNX Model**: It’s good practice to run a quick inference with ONNX Runtime and compare outputs to the original model to ensure fidelity. Use the same dummy input on ORT and verify the outputs match the PyTorch output within tolerance.

**Citation (ONNX Export)**: PyTorch’s `torch.onnx.export()` will trace the model with a sample input and produce an ONNX graph ([(optional) Exporting a Model from PyTorch to ONNX and Running it using ONNX Runtime — PyTorch Tutorials 2.6.0+cu124 documentation](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/advanced/super_resolution_with_onnxruntime.html#:~:text=Exporting%20a%20model%20in%20PyTorch,model%20will%20thus%20accept%20inputs)). You can mark certain dimensions as dynamic so that the ONNX model can handle varying input sizes (e.g., variable batch dimension) ([(optional) Exporting a Model from PyTorch to ONNX and Running it using ONNX Runtime — PyTorch Tutorials 2.6.0+cu124 documentation](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/advanced/super_resolution_with_onnxruntime.html#:~:text=,where%20batch_size%20can%20be%20variable)). Use a stable opset and verify the model with ONNX’s checker ([Help needen to convert torch models to onnx  : r/pytorch](https://www.reddit.com/r/pytorch/comments/1cxk54z/help_needen_to_convert_torch_models_to_onnx/#:~:text=%2A%20Data%20Types%3A%20Double,range%20expected%20by%20your%20model)) to ensure compatibility.

## 3. Test-Time Compute Techniques in ONNX Runtime
With the model in ONNX format, you can leverage **test-time compute enhancements** to improve inference robustness and performance. These include Test-Time Augmentation (TTA), Test-Time Training (TTT), and iterative/ensemble inference methods. Here’s how to apply them within an ONNX Runtime inference workflow:

- **Test-Time Augmentation (TTA)**: TTA improves model predictions by averaging results from multiple augmented inputs. The idea is to apply various transformations to the test input (e.g. flips, rotations, crops), run the ONNX model on each augmented input, and then combine the outputs. This is done at inference time to **boost accuracy**. For example, in computer vision, you might flip an image horizontally and feed both the original and flipped images through the model, then average the predictions. In code, you can implement TTA with ONNX Runtime by looping over augmentations:
  ```python
  import onnxruntime as ort
  import numpy as np

  session = ort.InferenceSession("model.onnx")
  input_name = session.get_inputs()[0].name

  def tta_inference(image: np.ndarray):
      # Define test-time augmentations (e.g., identity, horizontal flip)
      augments = [lambda x: x, 
                  lambda x: np.flip(x, axis=2)]  # simple example: flip horizontally
      outputs = []
      for aug in augments:
          aug_input = aug(image.copy())
          ort_outputs = session.run(None, {input_name: aug_input})
          outputs.append(ort_outputs[0])
      # Combine outputs (e.g., average for regression or probability, vote for labels)
      return np.mean(outputs, axis=0)
  
  result = tta_inference(test_image_np)
  ```
  This procedure feeds `test_image_np` and its flipped version into the model and averages the predictions. TTA is **simple to implement** and can yield better accuracy at the cost of extra compute ([Test Time Augmentation (TTA) ... worth it? - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/andrewkh/test-time-augmentation-tta-worth-it#:~:text=TTA%20is%20simply%20to%20apply,transformed%20images%20to%20the)). *For instance, “TTA is simply to apply different transformations to the test image (rotations, flipping, translations) then feed these transformed images to the model” and aggregate the results ([Test Time Augmentation (TTA) ... worth it? - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/andrewkh/test-time-augmentation-tta-worth-it#:~:text=TTA%20is%20simply%20to%20apply,transformed%20images%20to%20the)).* Make sure the augmentations are the same types of transformations the model was trained to handle.

- **Test-Time Training (TTT)**: TTT adapts the model to each test sample or batch by performing a brief training or fine-tuning step during inference. The model “learns” from the test input itself (without ground-truth labels) to adjust its internal parameters for better predictions under distribution shift ([〖論文メモ〗Test-Time Training with Self-Supervision for Generalization under Distribution Shifts – 行李の底に収めたり[YuWd]](https://yuiga.dev/blog/posts/test-time_training_with_self-supervision_for_generalization_under_distribution_shifts/#:~:text=%2A%20train%E3%81%A8test%E3%81%A7%E5%88%86%E5%B8%83%E3%81%8C%E9%81%95%E3%81%86%E5%A0%B4%E5%90%88%E3%81%AE%E5%86%8D%E5%AD%A6%E7%BF%92%E6%89%8B%E6%B3%95TTT%28Test)). In practice, this often involves an **auxiliary self-supervised loss**. For example, one technique is to minimize the model’s prediction entropy on the test sample (“Tent” – test-time entropy minimization) by updating batch normalization statistics or a small subset of parameters. With ONNX Runtime, there are two ways to do TTT:
  1. **On-Device Training with ORT**: ONNX Runtime has a training API (ORTTraining) that can perform gradient updates on ONNX models. You would export not only the inference graph but also a training graph (including loss computation). Then, using ORT’s training session or the PyTorch-ORT module, run a few training iterations on the single test sample or batch. For example, you could export the model with a dummy loss (or use ORTModule on your PyTorch model) and call `optimizer.step()` a few times at inference time. ONNX Runtime’s on-device training workflow is: export model to ONNX, prepare training artifacts (loss function, optimizer), deploy to device, and perform training steps on-device ([On-Device Training with ONNX Runtime: A deep dive - Microsoft Open Source Blog](https://opensource.microsoft.com/blog/2023/07/05/on-device-training-with-onnx-runtime-a-deep-dive/#:~:text=On,on%20a%20device%20with%20ORT)). This is an advanced approach, requiring that your runtime environment has the capability to perform training (e.g., a device with ORT training support, like mobile with NNAPI training or a custom build).
  2. **Lightweight Adaptation in Python**: If full ORT training is not feasible, you can implement a custom adaptation loop in Python. For instance, evaluate the ONNX model on the test input, calculate a self-supervised loss (like reconstruction error or entropy of predictions), and adjust the model weights accordingly. Directly modifying ONNX weights is non-trivial, so a practical approach is to maintain a small PyTorch copy of part of the model (e.g., a batchnorm layer or adapter layer) that you update, and run the rest of the model in ORT. This hybrid approach uses ORT for most of the model and PyTorch for the part being adapted at test time.
  
  **Example (BatchNorm adaptation)**: Suppose your model has BatchNorm layers that were fixed after training. At inference, you can collect statistics from the test batch and update the running mean/var to better match the test data. This can be done by feeding the test batch through the model (via ORT), computing new mean/variance, and then overwriting those values in the ONNX model (the ONNX model’s BatchNorm nodes have scale, bias, mean, var inputs that you can modify using an ONNX graph editor or by re-exporting with updated stats). This effectively *trains* the normalization layers on the test batch without labels.
  
  **Important**: TTT should be done cautiously in deployment, as it introduces extra overhead and complexity. If using ORT’s training capabilities, ensure the procedure is fast and does not degrade the user experience. The concept of TTT is powerful – *“since the hidden state is updated by training even on test sequences, we call these Test-Time Training layers”* ([GitHub - test-time-training/ttt-lm-jax: Official JAX implementation of Learning to (Learn at Test Time): RNNs with Expressive Hidden States](https://github.com/test-time-training/ttt-lm-jax#:~:text=Since%20the%20hidden%20state%20is,layer%20MLP%20respectively)) – but it requires careful implementation to be practical.

- **Iterative Inference & Self-Ensembling**: Iterative inference refers to running the model multiple times in a feedback loop to refine the result. One use-case is **iterative output refinement** (common in diffusion models or sequence generation) where the output of one inference step is fed as input to the next. Another case is **Monte Carlo Dropout ensembling** – run the model many times with dropout enabled and average the results as an uncertainty estimate.
  
  In ONNX, you can achieve iterative inference by either controlling the loop in Python or by using ONNX’s built-in loop operators:
  - *External Loop*: Simply run `session.run()` in a Python loop, feeding the output from one iteration as input to the next. For example, if your model’s output is used to update the input (like an RNN hidden state or a refinement of an image):
    ```python
    state = initial_state
    for i in range(num_iters):
        out, new_state = session.run(None, {input_name: data, state_name: state})
        state = new_state  # feed back
    final_output = out
    ```
    This gives you full control to implement things like beam search (for NLP) or iterative segmentation refinement.
  - *ONNX Loop Operator*: ONNX supports a `Loop` construct in the graph itself. You could embed your iterative logic into the model so that ONNX Runtime executes the loop internally. For example, a Loop can run a subgraph a fixed number of times or until a condition is met. This is more complex to set up (you’d need to modify the ONNX graph to include Loop and possibly carry state variables), but has the advantage of keeping all computation inside ORT (faster and avoids Python overhead). If your scenario requires dozens of iterations (e.g., 50 denoising steps in a diffusion model), embedding a loop node could be beneficial.
  
  - *Ensembling and Multi-Model* Inference: ONNX Runtime can load multiple models or one model multiple times. You can implement a simple ensemble by loading several ONNX models (perhaps trained with different initializations) and averaging their predictions. This is akin to iterative self-ensemble (though the models are fixed). Running them in parallel threads or sequentially and averaging results can improve robustness.

In summary, test-time techniques like TTA and TTT can be applied with ONNX Runtime but require orchestration in your inference code. **TTA** is straightforward: apply transforms and aggregate outputs ([Test Time Augmentation (TTA) ... worth it? - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/andrewkh/test-time-augmentation-tta-worth-it#:~:text=TTA%20is%20simply%20to%20apply,transformed%20images%20to%20the)). **TTT** can be done via ORT’s training engine or manual weight updates to adapt the model on the fly ([GitHub - test-time-training/ttt-lm-jax: Official JAX implementation of Learning to (Learn at Test Time): RNNs with Expressive Hidden States](https://github.com/test-time-training/ttt-lm-jax#:~:text=Since%20the%20hidden%20state%20is,layer%20MLP%20respectively)). And iterative inference or ensembling can be scripted using loops or ONNX graph constructs for better results.

## 4. ONNX Runtime Optimization
To maximize inference performance, leverage ONNX Runtime’s optimization features. This includes model quantization, selecting the right Execution Provider (EP) for your hardware, and enabling graph optimizations:

- **Quantization for Speed and Efficiency**: Quantization converts the model weights (and optionally activations) from 32-bit floats to lower precision (like 8-bit integers) to reduce memory and increase speed. ONNX Runtime provides easy APIs for post-training quantization:
  - *Dynamic Quantization*: Quantize weights to int8 while keeping activations in float. This is easiest and works well for **CPU inference** on NLP models. *“Dynamic quantization calculates the quantization parameters (scale and zero point) for activations on the fly.”* ([Quantize ONNX Models - ONNXRuntime](https://iot-robotics.github.io/ONNXRuntime/docs/performance/quantization.html#:~:text=training%20quantization)) It’s recommended for RNN/transformer models ([Quantize ONNX models | onnxruntime](https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/performance/model-optimizations/quantization.html#:~:text=match%20at%20L370%20In%20general%2C,static%20quantization%20for%20CNN%20models)). Example:
    ```python
    from onnxruntime.quantization import quantize_dynamic, QuantType
    quantize_dynamic("model.onnx", "model_int8.onnx", weight_type=QuantType.QInt8)
    ``` 
    This will produce an int8-quantized model file. Since activation quantization is dynamic, you don’t need calibration data. **Tip**: Dynamic quantization is one-line and safe; try it first to see if you get a speedup with acceptable accuracy.
  
  - *Static Quantization*: Quantize both weights and activations to int8, using calibration data to determine activation ranges. This often yields better performance on CNNs and is needed for some hardware accelerators. You’ll supply a representative dataset and run:
    ```python
    from onnxruntime.quantization import quantize_static, CalibrationDataReader
    # Prepare CalibrationDataReader that yields calibration inputs
    quantize_static("model.onnx", "model_int8.onnx", calibration_data_reader, quant_format=QuantFormat.QDQ)
    ```
    Static quantization inserts QuantizeLinear/DequantizeLinear nodes (QDQ format) into the model to simulate quantization ([Quantize ONNX models | onnxruntime](https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/performance/model-optimizations/quantization.html#:~:text=%2A%20Operator,quantization%20parameters%20on%20the%20fly)) ([Quantize ONNX models | onnxruntime](https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/performance/model-optimizations/quantization.html#:~:text=ONNX%20Runtime%20provides%20python%20APIs,processing%2C%20dynamic%2Fstatic%20quantization%2C%20and%20debugging)). Ensure to evaluate accuracy after quantization; some models may need Quantization-Aware Training if accuracy drops too much.
  
  - *Quantization Guidelines*: In general, use dynamic quantization for transformer models and static for CNNs ([Quantize ONNX models | onnxruntime](https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/performance/model-optimizations/quantization.html#:~:text=match%20at%20L370%20In%20general%2C,static%20quantization%20for%20CNN%20models)). ONNX Runtime supports both **QOperator** format (quantized ops like `QLinearConv`) and **QDQ** format; the latter is more flexible and is used by the quantization APIs by default ([Quantize ONNX models | onnxruntime](https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/performance/model-optimizations/quantization.html#:~:text=%2A%20Operator,also%20carry%20the%20quantization%20parameters)). Quantization can bring significant speedups especially on CPU and on integer neural accelerators, with minimal loss in accuracy if done properly. It also reduces model size (important for edge deployments).

- **Graph Optimizations**: ONNX Runtime by default applies a suite of graph optimizations to your model when you create an InferenceSession. Optimizations include node fusions (e.g., combining Conv+BatchNorm, or conv+activation into one) and constant folding. There are multiple optimization levels:
  - *Basic (ORT_ENABLE_BASIC)*: Removes no-ops, merges certain nodes.
  - *Extended (ORT_ENABLE_EXTENDED)*: Includes more complex fusions (GEMM + activation, etc.).
  - *All (ORT_ENABLE_ALL)*: Includes extended plus layout optimizations (e.g., NCHW -> NCHWc for Intel CPU). This is the highest level ([Graph optimizations | onnxruntime](https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/performance/model-optimizations/graph-optimizations.html#:~:text=%2A%20GraphOptimizationLevel%3A%3AORT_ENABLE_ALL%20,available%20optimizations%20including%20layout%20optimizations)).
  
  By default, **ORT_ENABLE_ALL** is used for Python inference sessions ([Thread management | onnxruntime](https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/performance/tune-performance/threading.html#:~:text=sess_options,1)) ([Thread management | onnxruntime](https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/performance/tune-performance/threading.html#:~:text=,Pool%20Spinning%20Behavior)). You can explicitly set this:
  ```python
  sess_options = ort.SessionOptions()
  sess_options.graph_optimization_level = ort.GraphOptimizationLevel.ORT_ENABLE_ALL
  session = ort.InferenceSession("model.onnx", sess_options=sess_options)
  ```
  At ORT_ENABLE_ALL, the runtime will perform all known optimizations, including platform-specific ones, to maximize speed. For example, it might fuse a sequence of ops into a single GPU kernel. Graph optimizations can dramatically improve throughput without changing the model’s outputs. In one workflow, running the ONNX model through all optimizations (ORT_ENABLE_ALL) before inference gave a big speed boost ([Performant on-device inferencing with ONNX Runtime](https://opensource.microsoft.com/blog/2023/02/08/performant-on-device-inferencing-with-onnx-runtime/#:~:text=Runtime%20opensource,ORT_ENABLE_ALL%2C%20to)). You can even serialize the optimized model (with `sessionOptions.optimized_model_filepath = ...`) to avoid repeating optimization on each startup (useful for large models to reduce load time).

- **Execution Provider (EP) Selection**: ONNX Runtime supports various hardware accelerators via EPs ([Execution Providers | onnxruntime](https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/execution-providers/#:~:text=ONNX%20Runtime%20supports%20many%20different,application%20using%20the%20different%20options)). Choosing the right EP (or combination) is crucial for performance:
  - *CPU:* The default CPUExecutionProvider is highly optimized (uses OpenMP, MLAS, etc., and can utilize all CPU cores). If running on Intel CPUs, ORT can internally use oneDNN (DNNL) for acceleration. For ARM CPUs, ORT can use ARM Compute Library or Neon optimizations. The CPU EP is a good fallback for any environment but might not meet real-time latency for large models.
  - *GPU (CUDA):* For NVIDIA GPUs, use `CUDAExecutionProvider`. This uses CUDA kernels for all ops it can, offloading the heavy compute to the GPU. It’s as simple as:
    ```python
    ort.InferenceSession("model.onnx", providers=['CUDAExecutionProvider', 'CPUExecutionProvider'])
    ```
    By listing CUDA first and CPU second, ORT will try to run every node on CUDA and fall back to CPU if an op isn’t supported on GPU ([Execution Providers | onnxruntime](https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/execution-providers/#:~:text=,capable%2C%20otherwise%20execute%20using%20CPUExecutionProvider)). Ensure you installed the onnxruntime-gpu package. This yields a big speedup for parallelizable models.
  - *GPU (TensorRT):* For maximum NVIDIA performance, you can use the TensorRT EP. TensorRT will convert supported portions of the ONNX graph into a highly optimized engine (with FP16 or INT8 precision if allowed). *“With the TensorRT execution provider, ONNX Runtime delivers better inferencing performance on the same hardware compared to generic GPU acceleration.”* ([NVIDIA - TensorRT | onnxruntime](https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/execution-providers/TensorRT-ExecutionProvider.html#:~:text=With%20the%20TensorRT%20execution%20provider%2C,compared%20to%20generic%20GPU%20acceleration)) In practice, TensorRT EP can nearly double throughput vs. CUDA EP for CNNs. Usage:
    ```python
    ort.InferenceSession("model.onnx", providers=['TensorrtExecutionProvider', 'CUDAExecutionProvider', 'CPUExecutionProvider'])
    ```
    (Make sure TensorRT is installed and the onnxruntime-tensorrt package is used.) The providers list order is priority ([Execution Providers | onnxruntime](https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/execution-providers/#:~:text=,capable%2C%20otherwise%20execute%20using%20CPUExecutionProvider)).
  - *DirectML:* On Windows or for any DirectX12-compatible GPU (including AMD or Intel GPUs), DirectML EP is very useful. *“The DirectML EP accelerates inference on commodity GPU hardware, greatly improving evaluation time without sacrificing broad hardware support.”* ([Windows - DirectML | onnxruntime](https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/execution-providers/DirectML-ExecutionProvider.html#:~:text=The%20DirectML%20Execution%20Provider%20is,specific%20extensions%20to%20be%20installed)) This means you can use GPUs that aren’t CUDA-enabled. Simply install `onnxruntime-directml` package and specify `['DmlExecutionProvider']` as the provider. This is great for Windows apps running on various GPUs (gaming cards or integrated graphics).
  - *OpenVINO:* For Intel CPUs (and integrated GPUs/VPU) deployments, the OpenVINO EP can optimize execution using Intel’s inference engine. It can yield latency improvements by using vector instructions and neural accelerators on Intel hardware.
  - *NPU/Edge EPs:* ORT supports a range of specialized accelerators: NVIDIA Jetson (TensorRT on Jetson), ARM NPU (via ArmNN or ETHOS-U), Android NNAPI (for mobile SoC DSPs), Apple CoreML (for iOS devices, preview), Huawei Ascend, etc. ([Execution Providers | onnxruntime](https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/execution-providers/#:~:text=CPU%20GPU%20IoT%2FEdge%2FMobile%20Other%20Default,preview)). If deploying to mobile, for example, using NNAPI EP can offload to the phone’s AI chip for faster and power-efficient inference.

  **Selecting EPs:** You can query available providers with `ort.get_available_providers()`. Always list a CPU provider last as a fallback. Some EPs can be combined – ORT will partition the graph to run some ops on one EP and others on another if needed. For instance, if TensorRT cannot handle a particular layer (e.g., a custom op), it will fall back to CUDA or CPU for that part ([CUDA and TensorRT Execution Providers in ONNX Runtime ...](https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/end-to-end-ai-for-nvidia-based-pcs-cuda-and-tensorrt-execution-providers-in-onnx-runtime/242159#:~:text=CUDA%20and%20TensorRT%20Execution%20Providers,fallback%20to%20CUDA%20Execution)). The EP mechanism is flexible: *“the list of providers is ordered by priority. For example `['CUDAExecutionProvider', 'CPUExecutionProvider']` means use CUDA if capable, otherwise CPU”* ([Execution Providers | onnxruntime](https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/execution-providers/#:~:text=,capable%2C%20otherwise%20execute%20using%20CPUExecutionProvider)). 

- **Other Performance Knobs**: 
  - *Intra-op Threads*: By default, ORT uses multithreading for CPU ops. You can limit threads via `SessionOptions.intra_op_num_threads` if needed (e.g., to avoid saturating a CPU when running multiple models).
  - *Inter-op Parallelism*: If your model has parallel branches, you can try `ExecutionMode.ORT_PARALLEL` to execute independent graph parts concurrently ([Thread management | onnxruntime](https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/performance/tune-performance/threading.html#:~:text=)).
  - *Batching*: If throughput is more important than single-image latency (e.g., server scenario), consider batching multiple inputs together to better utilize vector units or GPU cores.
  - *Memory Arena*: ORT’s memory patterns optimization (enabled by default) allocates memory buffers ahead of time for known tensor sizes, which improves performance but uses more memory. You can tweak this if memory is constrained.

By combining quantization and the right EP, you can often achieve **an order-of-magnitude speedup**. For example, a model quantized to INT8 and running on a TensorRT EP or on an Edge TPU EP can be vastly faster than the baseline FP32 on CPU. Always profile the performance with ORT’s tools (e.g., `onnxruntime.tools.profiler`) or simple timing loops to ensure your optimizations are effective ([No performance different between ORT_ENABLE_ALL and ... - GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/issues/4816#:~:text=No%20performance%20different%20between%20ORT_ENABLE_ALL,diff%20here%2C%20that%20warrants%20investigation)).

**Citation (Optimization)**: ONNX Runtime provides Python APIs to convert a float32 model to int8 (quantization) for speedups ([Quantize ONNX models | onnxruntime](https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/performance/model-optimizations/quantization.html#:~:text=ONNX%20Runtime%20provides%20python%20APIs,processing%2C%20dynamic%2Fstatic%20quantization%2C%20and%20debugging)). There are dynamic, static, and QAT quantization modes available ([Quantize ONNX Models - ONNXRuntime](https://iot-robotics.github.io/ONNXRuntime/docs/performance/quantization.html#:~:text=There%20are%203%20ways%20of,aware%20training%20quantization)). It’s recommended to use dynamic quantization for transformers and static for CNNs ([Quantize ONNX models | onnxruntime](https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/performance/model-optimizations/quantization.html#:~:text=match%20at%20L370%20In%20general%2C,static%20quantization%20for%20CNN%20models)). Also, ONNX Runtime supports many execution providers – e.g., TensorRT EP for NVIDIA GPUs yields higher performance than generic CUDA execution ([NVIDIA - TensorRT | onnxruntime](https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/execution-providers/TensorRT-ExecutionProvider.html#:~:text=With%20the%20TensorRT%20execution%20provider%2C,compared%20to%20generic%20GPU%20acceleration)), and DirectML EP accelerates inference on a broad range of Windows GPUs ([Windows - DirectML | onnxruntime](https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/execution-providers/DirectML-ExecutionProvider.html#:~:text=The%20DirectML%20Execution%20Provider%20is,specific%20extensions%20to%20be%20installed)). You can prioritize providers in code, with fallback to CPU ([Execution Providers | onnxruntime](https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/execution-providers/#:~:text=,capable%2C%20otherwise%20execute%20using%20CPUExecutionProvider)). Finally, enabling **all graph optimizations** (`ORT_ENABLE_ALL`) will apply the full set of fusion and layout optimizations for maximum speed ([Graph optimizations | onnxruntime](https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/performance/model-optimizations/graph-optimizations.html#:~:text=%2A%20GraphOptimizationLevel%3A%3AORT_ENABLE_ALL%20,available%20optimizations%20including%20layout%20optimizations)).

## 5. Deployment Considerations
Integrating test-time compute techniques into your ONNX inference pipeline requires careful consideration of the target environment (cloud server, mobile app, embedded device) and hardware capabilities:

- **Hardware Resource Constraints**: 
  - *CPU-only Deployments*: If using only a CPU (e.g., a microservice on an x86 server or a small edge device like Raspberry Pi), you might rely on the default CPU EP with optimizations. Ensure the model is quantized if the CPU is limited (int8 can be run efficiently on x86 via AVX512 VNNI or on ARM via NEON). Use batching sparingly on CPU if latency is critical, and prefer simpler TTA (maybe only a couple of augmentations) to avoid slowdowns. If deploying on Intel CPUs, consider using the OpenVINO EP for additional speedup (it’s designed for Intel hardware acceleration).
  - *GPU Deployments*: If a GPU is available, decide between using the general CUDA EP or a vendor-specific EP. On an NVIDIA data center GPU, TensorRT EP will give best throughput for large batches or heavy models, whereas CUDA EP might be simpler for development (TensorRT has longer initialization time to build engines). On consumer GPUs (like GeForce), CUDA EP is straightforward. For AMD GPUs or scenarios like Windows Desktop apps, DirectML EP is ideal as it covers all GPU brands via DirectX12 ([Windows - DirectML | onnxruntime](https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/execution-providers/DirectML-ExecutionProvider.html#:~:text=The%20DirectML%20Execution%20Provider%20is,specific%20extensions%20to%20be%20installed)). Make sure to distribute the correct onnxruntime package with GPU support. **Memory** is a consideration: GPU memory can fill up with large models or large TTA batches – monitor usage and possibly reduce batch size or resolution to fit memory.
  - *Mobile and Edge*: On Android, use the NNAPI EP if available to utilize the phone’s NPU/DSP – this can greatly increase speed and reduce power usage. On iOS, ORT’s CoreML EP (in preview) can offload to the Apple Neural Engine. For single-board computers with NPUs (like Google Coral, NVIDIA Jetson, Intel Movidius), use specialized EPs (e.g., TensorRT on Jetson, or OpenVINO for Movidius via VPU). Keep in mind that **test-time training on mobile** is challenging – most mobile deployments won’t have the luxury of doing backprop due to limited compute and no training libraries on device. If TTT is needed (e.g., personalized models on-device), you might rely on ORT’s on-device training support and ensure the device can handle it (perhaps only update a small part of the model).
  - *Edge Cases*: If deploying to Web via WebAssembly, ORT can run in the browser (with the WebAssembly EP or WebGPU EP). In that scenario, you likely won’t do heavy TTA or any TTT because the compute in JavaScript/WebAssembly is limited. Focus on quantization and optimized models for web deployments.

- **Latency vs Throughput Trade-offs**: Test-time augmentations and iterative inference will **increase latency** because multiple inference passes are performed. In a real-time application (e.g., live video feed or interactive app), excessive TTA could be detrimental. A common practice is to enable TTA only in certain cases – for example, run the primary inference quickly, and if the result confidence is low, trigger a TTA routine to double-check the prediction. This adaptive approach balances speed and accuracy. Similarly, test-time training might be done asynchronously or only on a subset of data (e.g., personalize the model overnight on new user data rather than on each inference). Always measure the end-to-end latency with these techniques enabled to ensure it meets your requirements.

- **Batching TTA for Efficiency**: If you do use TTA on a GPU, you can concatenate the augmented inputs into a single batch and run one forward pass. For example, 5 augmentations of a 1 image can be batched into shape [5, C, H, W] and fed at once – the GPU will handle them in parallel and you then average the outputs. This is more efficient than 5 separate inference calls. ORT allows this as long as you defined the first dimension as dynamic. On CPU, threading will internally parallelize across the batch as well. This trick turns TTA’s multiple inferences into one larger inference.

- **Concurrency and Throughput**: In server deployments, you may serve multiple requests concurrently. ONNX Runtime can be used in multi-threaded servers – each InferenceSession is thread-safe for concurrent Run calls, or you can create multiple sessions. If using test-time training online, be careful with concurrency (you don’t want two threads training on the same model instance simultaneously). It might be better to deep-copy a session or serialize the model, perform TTT on the copy for one request, and not affect others.

- **Monitoring and Fallbacks**: Introduce monitoring to verify that these test-time computations are actually helping. Track metrics like accuracy improvement from TTA or how often TTT yields better outcomes. If gains are marginal, you might disable them in production for simplicity. Always have a fallback path: e.g., if the ONNX Runtime with a GPU EP fails to initialize (maybe driver issue), fall back to CPU EP (possibly with a smaller model or fewer augments). Design your deployment to handle absence of certain hardware gracefully.

- **DSPy Integration in Deployment**: Since DSPy is a Python framework, deploying a DSPy pipeline directly is suitable for controlled environments. In many production scenarios, you might extract the learned components (like the optimized model) and deploy them in a lean runtime (like ORT for the model, without the DSPy dependency). However, you can still use DSPy in production if your application is in Python – for example, a Flask API that uses DSPy to orchestrate the steps: DSPy can load the ONNX model (perhaps via a custom Tool) and perform TTA/TTT logic as part of the pipeline. Just ensure to disable any development logging and use DSPy’s optimized module (from training phase) for inference.

In summary, **match the complexity to the hardware**: on powerful GPUs/CPUs, you can afford TTA or even fine-tuning at inference, whereas on edge devices you lean on static optimizations (quantization, efficient EPs) and lightweight methods. The goal is to improve model accuracy or robustness *without* unduly harming performance or reliability in the field.

## 6. Code Examples (DSPy & ONNX Runtime Integration)
Below are some simplified code snippets demonstrating how you might integrate DSPy training with ONNX Runtime inference and test-time enhancements:

**A. Training with DSPy and Exporting to ONNX (PyTorch example)**

```python
import dspy
import torch
# 1. Define a DSPy module (e.g., a simple text classifier using a PyTorch model internally)
signature = dspy.Signature("text -> sentiment")  # example sentiment classifier
class SimpleClassifier(dspy.Tool):  # Using DSPy Tool to wrap a PyTorch model
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        # Suppose we have a PyTorch model defined elsewhere
        self.model = MyPyTorchModel()  
    def __call__(self, text: str) -> str:
        # preprocess text to tensor
        inp = preprocess_text(text)
        logits = self.model(inp)
        return "positive" if logits.argmax().item() == 1 else "negative"

classifier = SimpleClassifier()

# 2. Optimize the module with DSPy (train it)
trainset = [dspy.Example(inp, label=lbl).with_inputs("text") for inp, lbl in training_data] 
optimizer = dspy.Optimizer(metric="accuracy")
optimized_classifier = optimizer.compile(classifier, trainset=trainset)
# At this point, optimized_classifier.model is the trained PyTorch model.

# 3. Export the PyTorch model to ONNX
optimized_classifier.model.eval()
dummy_input = torch.randn(1, 768)  # e.g., if model expects 768-dim input
torch.onnx.export(optimized_classifier.model, dummy_input, "classifier.onnx",
                  opset_version=13, input_names=["input"], output_names=["output"],
                  dynamic_axes={"input": {0: "batch_size"}, "output": {0: "batch_size"}})
print("ONNX model saved!")
```

In this snippet, we define a DSPy Tool that encapsulates a PyTorch model. After training via DSPy’s optimizer (which internally might call `.backward()` on the PyTorch model through the `Example` supervision), we export the learned model to ONNX. We used `dynamic_axes` to allow variable batch sizes in the ONNX model ([(optional) Exporting a Model from PyTorch to ONNX and Running it using ONNX Runtime — PyTorch Tutorials 2.6.0+cu124 documentation](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/advanced/super_resolution_with_onnxruntime.html#:~:text=,where%20batch_size%20can%20be%20variable)). The ONNX file `classifier.onnx` is now ready for inference.

**B. ONNX Runtime Inference with Test-Time Augmentation**

```python
import onnxruntime as ort
import numpy as np
from PIL import Image

# Load the ONNX model into an inference session (use GPU if available)
sess_options = ort.SessionOptions()
sess_options.graph_optimization_level = ort.GraphOptimizationLevel.ORT_ENABLE_ALL
session = ort.InferenceSession("classifier.onnx", sess_options=sess_options,
                               providers=["CPUExecutionProvider"])  # use "CUDAExecutionProvider" if GPU

# Assume the model expects an image of shape (1, 3, H, W) for classification
input_name = session.get_inputs()[0].name

def preprocess(image: Image.Image) -> np.ndarray:
    arr = np.array(image.resize((224,224)), dtype=np.float32) / 255.0
    arr = arr.transpose(2,0,1)[None, ...]  # shape (1,3,224,224)
    return arr

def infer_with_tta(image: Image.Image) -> np.ndarray:
    # Define a set of test-time augmentations (identity, horizontal flip)
    aug_funcs = [
        lambda img: img, 
        lambda img: img.transpose(Image.FLIP_LEFT_RIGHT)
    ]
    preds = []
    for aug in aug_funcs:
        aug_img = aug(image)
        inp = preprocess(aug_img)
        output = session.run(None, {input_name: inp})[0]  # get model output
        preds.append(output)
    preds = np.stack(preds, axis=0)
    mean_pred = preds.mean(axis=0)  # average the predictions
    return mean_pred

# Example usage:
img = Image.open("test.jpg")
prediction = infer_with_tta(img)
print("Ensembled prediction:", prediction)
```

This code demonstrates using ONNX Runtime for inference with TTA. We load the ONNX model, then define a function that performs two augmentations (none and horizontal flip) on an input image. Each augmented image is preprocessed and run through the model using `session.run`. We collect all outputs and compute their average as the final prediction ([Test Time Augmentation (TTA) ... worth it? - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/andrewkh/test-time-augmentation-tta-worth-it#:~:text=TTA%20is%20simply%20to%20apply,transformed%20images%20to%20the)). This kind of ensemble typically yields a more stable prediction than a single pass.

**C. Quantizing the ONNX model for faster inference**

```python
import onnxruntime as ort
from onnxruntime.quantization import quantize_dynamic, QuantType

quantize_dynamic("classifier.onnx", "classifier_int8.onnx", weight_type=QuantType.QInt8)
print("Quantized INT8 model saved!")

# Load the quantized model
quant_session = ort.InferenceSession("classifier_int8.onnx", providers=["CPUExecutionProvider"])
```

Using ONNX Runtime’s quantization API, we converted the model to INT8 with a single call. We chose dynamic quantization which doesn’t require calibration data and is generally safe for transformers or fully-connected models ([Quantize ONNX Models - ONNXRuntime](https://iot-robotics.github.io/ONNXRuntime/docs/performance/quantization.html#:~:text=Quantization%20has%203%20main%20APIs%2C,to%20the%203%20quantization%20methods)). The resulting `classifier_int8.onnx` will have quantized weights. We then create an ORT session for the quantized model. Typically, the quantized model will run faster on CPU (often ~2-4x speedup) with minimal accuracy drop. *Note: If more control is needed, consider static quantization with calibration data or quantization-aware training if supported.* 

**D. Selecting Execution Providers and using ORT in DSPy pipeline**

```python
# When creating the session, choose appropriate execution providers
providers = []
# e.g., prefer NVIDIA TensorRT if available, then CUDA, then CPU:
if ort.get_device() == 'GPU':
    providers = ["TensorrtExecutionProvider", "CUDAExecutionProvider", "CPUExecutionProvider"]
else:
    providers = ["CPUExecutionProvider"]
session = ort.InferenceSession("classifier_int8.onnx", providers=providers)

# Optionally, integrate ORT session into a DSPy Tool for streamlined use in pipeline:
class ONNXInferenceTool(dspy.Tool):
    def __call__(self, input_tensor: np.ndarray):
        return session.run(None, {input_name: input_tensor})[0]

onnx_tool = ONNXInferenceTool()
# Now onnx_tool can be used inside a DSPy Module for inference as a step
result = onnx_tool(preprocess(img))  # use the tool just like any other function in DSPy
```

This snippet shows how to specify multiple execution providers when creating the session (TensorRT -> CUDA -> CPU) ([Execution Providers | onnxruntime](https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/execution-providers/#:~:text=,capable%2C%20otherwise%20execute%20using%20CPUExecutionProvider)). ONNX Runtime will delegate as much of the model as possible to TensorRT, and anything unsupported will fall back to CUDA or CPU ([CUDA and TensorRT Execution Providers in ONNX Runtime ...](https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/end-to-end-ai-for-nvidia-based-pcs-cuda-and-tensorrt-execution-providers-in-onnx-runtime/242159#:~:text=CUDA%20and%20TensorRT%20Execution%20Providers,fallback%20to%20CUDA%20Execution)). We also wrap the ORT session in a DSPy `Tool`, so that it can be seamlessly used in a DSPy pipeline. For example, you could incorporate `onnx_tool` as part of a larger DSPy program (for instance, one that does some pre-processing, then calls the ONNX model, then post-processes). This demonstrates DSPy’s integration: using its modular pipeline structure while leveraging the ONNX Runtime for the heavy lifting at inference time.

---

Each of these code blocks corresponds to stages in the pipeline: training with DSPy and exporting, running inference with test-time augmentation, optimizing via quantization, and deploying with the appropriate execution provider. By following this pipeline, you can go from a high-level DSPy model definition to a highly optimized ONNX model running with test-time enhancements on the target hardware.
